This repository contains many stand alone functions to make programming in c++ easier.
There are two main parts to this repository - Helpers and Statistics.

Helpers contains general purpose functions that are commonly used.
Everything in Helpers is in a namespace called "Helpers",
so to use these functions simply do:

#include "Helpers.h"

bool isValidRGB = Helpers::IsValidRGB(-1, 2, 50);

Statistics contains functions like Average, Variance, etc. that operate on generic
containers of generic elements. The TypeTraits header contains some magic to allow
these Statistics functions to return sensible types no matter the input type. For example,
we would typically want the mean of unsigned char's to return a float, not an unsigned char.
Everything in Statistics is in a "Statistics" namespace, so you can call them like:

#include "Statistics.h"

std::vector<unsigned char> values;
// ... fill values ...
float average = Statistics::Average(values);

Building Requirements
---------------------
This repository does not depend on any external libraries. The only caveat is that it depends
on c++0x/11 parts of the c++ language. For Linux, this means it must be built with the flag
gnu++0x. For Windows (Visual Studio 10), nothing special is required.
